# Twitter_Sentiment_Analysis
## Project Overview
Twitter sentiment analysis refers to the process of analyzing and categorizing the opinions expressed in tweets into predefined sentiment categories, typically positive, negative, or neutral. This analysis is valuable for a wide range of applications, including brand monitoring, public opinion tracking, political analysis, and social media research
## Features
1.⁠ ⁠Data Preprocessing
Clean and preprocess tweet data by performing the following actions:
Remove Punctuation: Strip punctuation marks (e.g., !, ?, ,, .) from the text.
Remove Stop Words: Eliminate common words like "the", "and", "is" that don’t carry significant meaning.
Remove Emojis: Remove emojis or convert them to their text equivalents to avoid confusion.
Remove URLs: Remove URLs (e.g., http://example.com) that are irrelevant to sentiment analysis.
Lowercase Conversion: Convert all text to lowercase for uniformity.
2.⁠ ⁠TF-IDF Vectorization
Convert the cleaned text into numerical features using the TF-IDF method:
Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF): A technique that transforms text into numerical data by evaluating word frequency and its importance across the entire dataset.
Vectorize the Data: Use TfidfVectorizer to convert preprocessed tweet text into feature vectors suitable for machine learning.
3.⁠ ⁠Sentiment Classification with Random Forest
Use a Random Forest classifier to predict sentiment:
Sentiment Categories: Assign sentiment labels (Positive, Negative, Neutral, Irrelevant) to tweets.
Train-Test Split: Divide the data into training and testing sets.
Train Model: Train a Random Forest classifier using the preprocessed tweet data.
Predict Sentiment: Use the trained model to predict the sentiment of new, unseen tweets.
Evaluate Model: Measure the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
